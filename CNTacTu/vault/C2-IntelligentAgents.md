# Autonomy
- Tính tự trị
  - Decisions making
- Adjustable: Decisions handed to a higher authority when this is benefical

# Agents and

## Objects
- Agent = object + **attitude**
  
- Object:
  - States
  - Message passing
  - Methods (operations that may be performed on this state)

- Attitude
  - Autonomous: Decide for themselves whether or not to follow other's requests
  - Smart: Flexible (reactive, pro-active, social) behaviour
  - Active: each agent has at least 1 thread of active control

## Expert systems
- Def: "expertise" about some (abstract) domain of discourse (bàn luận)
- Agent is **aware** of the world

## Intelligent agents and AI
- Agent can be built to operate in **a limited domain**
- A useful agent is not needed to solve all the AI's problems

# Environment Properties
- Observable: fully or partially
  - Fully: The agent can obtain complete, accurate, up-to-date information about the environment's state
- Deterministic or non-deterministic
  - Deterministic: Any action has a single **guaranteed effect** (no uncertainty)
- Static or dynamic
  - Static: Remain **unchanged** except by the agent's action
- Discrete or continuous
  - Discrete: **a fixed, finite number of actions** and percepts in it
- Episodic or non-episodic
  - Phân đoạn
  - Episodic environment
    - The performance of agent is **dependent on a number of discrete eptisodes**
    - No linkages between different scenarios
- Real time
  - **Time** plays a part in **evaluating** an agents performance

# Intelligent agents

## Reactive (environment aware)
- Phản ứng nhanh
- A reactive system is one that
  - Maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment
  - **Responds to changes** that occurs in it

## Pro-active
- Chuyên nghiệp
- Generating and attempting to achieve goals

## Social ability
- Taking **others** into account
- Cooperation: working **together** to achieve a **shared goal**
- Coordination: Managing the **interdependencies** between activities (sharing resources)
- Negotiation: To reach **agreements** on matters of **common interest**
  - Offer
  - Counter offer

## Other properties
- Mobility: moving
- Rationality (hợp lý): Act to achieve goals
- Veracity (xác thực): know the communication failures
- Benevolence (nhân từ): to help or not to help
- Learning/Adaption
